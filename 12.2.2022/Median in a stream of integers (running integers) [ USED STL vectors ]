//DONE ON MY OWN!! (used STL)
//TRIED UPTO 20 CASES, WORKED WELL 

/*QUESTION : Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in an efficient way. For simplicity assume, 
there are no duplicates. For example, let us consider the stream 5, 15, 1, 3 … 
*/

After reading 1st element of stream - 5 -> median - 5
After reading 2nd element of stream - 5, 15 -> median - 10
After reading 3rd element of stream - 5, 15, 1 -> median - 5
After reading 4th element of stream - 5, 15, 1, 3 -> median - 4, so on...
